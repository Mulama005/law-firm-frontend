          Understanding Debt Recovery in Kenya
        </motion.h2>

        <p>
          Debt recovery in Kenya involves a combination of contractual rights,
          statutory remedies, and litigation mechanisms. The **Banking Act,
          Insolvency Act (2015), and the Civil Procedure Act** form the core
          legal framework.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Demand Letters & Negotiation</h3>
        <p>
          Before litigation, creditors must issue formal demand letters. Many
          debts are resolved through negotiation or settlement to avoid lengthy
          court processes.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Court Litigation</h3>
        <p>
          Where settlement fails, creditors can file suits in the Magistrateâ€™s
          Court, High Court, or Commercial & Admiralty Division depending on
          claim size. Courts may issue garnishee orders, asset attachment, or
          liquidation proceedings.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Insolvency & Restructuring</h3>
        <p>
          The Insolvency Act (2015) allows restructuring of distressed
          businesses. Creditors may initiate liquidation or administration
          depending on the financial state of the debtor.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Banking Law Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          Lenders must comply with Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) regulations on
          interest rates, loan classification, and customer protection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effective debt recovery requires balancing creditor rights with debtor
          protections to ensure fairness and financial stability.
